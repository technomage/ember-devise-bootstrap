= EmberDeviseBootstrap
This project provides a login UI uising Ember.js and Twitter Bootstrap that
is compatible with Devise.

The first step is to extract this from an existing project and get it working in that
context.  This will work for the User resource, then it will be generalized for more
resources.

This project is released under the MIT-LICENSE.
